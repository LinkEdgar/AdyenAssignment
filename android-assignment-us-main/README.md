# Adyen Android Assignment

## Overview
This repository contains the coding challenge for Android developer candidates at Adyen. 
The task is to create an app using NASA's Astronomy Picture Of the Day (APOD) API.

## Setup
1. Register for an [API key](https://api.nasa.gov/).
2. Add your API key to `app/local.gradle` (see `local.gradle.example` for details).
3. Verify your API key by running `PlanetaryServiceTest`.
4. Create a local Git repository.

## Time Limit
We expect you to take around 4 hours to complete the assignment.
It doesn't need to be done in one sitting, but try to use the time limit to guide your decisions.

*It will not be feasible to complete all of the features/tasks, prioritize what to work on!*

## Features
1. APOD List Screen:

    <img src="screens/ListScreen.png" alt="APOD List Screen" width="300"/>     <img src="screens/ReorderDialog.png" alt="Dialog Sorting" width="300"/>
- Create a list of APODs (images only, no videos)
- Implement ordering
  * By title (ascending)
  * By date (descending)
2. APOD Details Screen:

    <img src="screens/DetailScreen.png" alt="Detail Screen" width="300"/>
- Show detailed information about a single APOD
3. Error Handling:

- Implement error screens (e.g., API errors)

## Resources
- Color schemes and icons are available in the resources folder
- Screen mockups are provided in the `screens` folder

## Evaluation Criteria
We will assess:
* Feature functionality and user experience
  - Portrait and landscape orientations
  - API call optimizations
  - Adherence to provided designs
* Architecture & Code style
* Test coverage and quality
* Rationale / prioritization behind implementation decisions

## Submission
Include your Git repository (with history intact) in the final zip file.

## Prioritization
Please provide a summary of your decision-making process while working on this assignment:

[Your prioritization summary here]
I prioritized testing of all business related objects such as mappers, viewmodels, and utility. Some ui components were 
not able to be build due to time constraints. One such case is the error and no network UI. My DI choice was koin but dagger or hilt would
work fine as well. Good separation of concern from the UI layer is another prioritization I made. Choosing to use a mapper to map response objects to 
UI models also allows for an easier use of models at the UI level. Given more time a local DB such as room could allow us to show older content to users while we update and fetch more.
